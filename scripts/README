Yambopy scripts
================================

Here you can find some user contributed scripts for yambopy.

1. merge_qp.py
 Merge QP databases from multiple yambo GW runs

2. analyse_gw.py
 After running a GW calculation with a gw_conv.py type of script you can analyse the data and plot the
 difference between a selected conduction and valence band at given k-points as a function of a convergence parameter.

3. analyse_bse.py
 After running a BSE calculation with a bse_conv.py type of script, you can analyse the data and plot either
 the bright excitons eigenenergies or the optical spectra as a function of a convergence parameter.
